Using jwt(jason web token)
There are three important parts of a JWT: Header, Payload, Signature. 
Together they are combined to a standard structure: header.payload.signature.
The Client typically attaches JWT in Authorization header with Bearer prefix
1)Authorization: Bearer [header].[payload].[signature]
2)x-access-token: [header].[payload].[signature]
installation: npm i jsonwebtoken
